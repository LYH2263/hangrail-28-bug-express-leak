"""1D First-Fit placement by garment length on a hang rail.

Express zone（快递专区）: a half-open interval [start_cm, end_cm) on a rail
reserved for express work orders. Normal orders must skip zone-internal gaps
even when the zone is empty; express orders try the zone first and fall back
to the regular scan when the zone has no fitting gap.
